My GitHub account was created a while ago in order for a project involving making a website for a restaurant.
The repository that I created was made for the lesson 6 lab in my Wake Tech CCP course. 
The first step I took to clone my repository was to click the clone repository button, then select the repository that I wanted to clone. After that, I selected where I wanted the cloned repository to be stored on my computer.
